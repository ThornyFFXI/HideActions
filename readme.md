# HideActions
This is a basic addon that alters server->client communication so it appears you do not know actions that you should know.  This can be used to slim down your ability, spell, weaponskill, mount, trait, and trust lists ingame.  To alter which items are blocked, edit the 'hidelist.lua' file.  Changes will not take effect until you zone.  Keep in mind that if you block something, the client won't let you force it via text command either, so don't block anything you might need.
